Community Clover Bot
==========

Purpose
----------
A bot that will help members of the Clover DevRel team manage questions on the Clover Developer Community forum (https://community.clover.com/index.html). This tool allows the team to quickly view what questions are waiting for a response and how long ago the last activity was. 

Currently in Slack, the bot simply provides a list ten questions that do not have an accepted answer and puts them in a dedicated Slack channel. 

There is a webpage version that separates questions into two sections: Last Response from Users and Last Response from Clover.

How to Use
----------
This should work with Python 2.7 and Python 3.6.

Install the things that make it go:
```
pip install -r requirements
```

Make it go:
```
python com_bot.py
```
